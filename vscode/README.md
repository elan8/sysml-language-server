## SysML v2 Language Support

This extension adds **SysML v2** (and **KerML**) language support to VS Code, powered by the `sysml-language-server`.

If you work with **MBSE** and want fast feedback while editing models, this extension provides IDE features like diagnostics, navigation, and completions across your workspace and (optionally) your library sources.

## Highlights

- **Language Server Protocol (LSP)** features for `.sysml` and `.kerml`
- **Workspace-aware**: features work across your whole workspace, not just the active file
- **Library indexing**: point the extension to library roots (for example the SysML v2 release repo) for richer navigation and completion
- **Bundled server binary** in published builds (with a safe fallback to `sysml-language-server` on your PATH)
- **Syntax highlighting** for SysML v2 / KerML

## Features

- **Diagnostics**: syntax/validation feedback as you type
- **Hover**: quick info on symbols
- **Completion**: suggestions while editing
- **Navigation**: go to definition, find references, rename
- **Symbols**: document symbols and workspace symbol search
- **Code actions & formatting**: where supported by the server

## Getting started

1. Install the extension.
2. Open any `.sysml` or `.kerml` file.
3. (Optional) Configure library roots for better cross-file navigation and completion.

## Configuration

This extension contributes the following settings:

- **`sysml-language-server.serverPath`**
  - Path to the `sysml-language-server` binary.
  - Default: `"sysml-language-server"`
  - Notes:
    - In published builds, the extension will try to use a **bundled** server when `serverPath` is left at the default.
    - Set an absolute path (or workspace-relative path) if you want to use a custom build.

- **`sysml-language-server.libraryPaths`**
  - An array of paths to **library roots** (absolute or workspace-relative).
  - Files under these paths are indexed for hover, go-to-definition, and completion.

Example `settings.json`:

```json
{
  "sysml-language-server.libraryPaths": [
    "../SysML-v2-Release",
    "./my-company-sysml-library"
  ]
}
```

## Troubleshooting

- **The server can’t be started**
  - If the bundled server isn’t available for your platform/arch (or you’re using a dev build), install `sysml-language-server` separately and ensure it’s on your PATH, or set `sysml-language-server.serverPath` to the binary location.

- **Libraries don’t resolve**
  - Make sure each entry in `sysml-language-server.libraryPaths` points to the **root folder(s)** that contain the library sources (and that the paths are correct relative to the opened workspace).
