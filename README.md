# sysml-language-server

Language server for [SysML v2](https://www.omg.org/sysml/sysmlv2/) (and KerML). Provides LSP over stdio and a VS Code extension.

## Features

- **LSP**: text sync, diagnostics, hover, completion, go to definition, find references, rename, document symbols, workspace symbol search, code actions, formatting.
- **Workspace-aware**: all features use `.sysml` and `.kerml` files across the workspace (and library paths).
- **Library paths**: add roots (e.g. [SysML-v2-Release](https://github.com/Systems-Modeling/SysML-v2-Release)) to `sysml-language-server.libraryPaths` in settings for hover, go-to-definition, and completion from libraries.
- **VS Code extension**: syntax highlighting for `.sysml` / `.kerml`.

## Installing

Download from [Releases](https://github.com/elan8/sysml-language-server/releases):
